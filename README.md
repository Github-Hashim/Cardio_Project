Heart Disease Prediction Project
Welcome to my Heart Disease Prediction project repository!

Overview
In this project, I've developed machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient attributes. Using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, I've implemented data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes to create accurate predictions.

Project Structure
heart.csv/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
cardio_project_1.ipynb/: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
LICENSE: Specifies the license for this project.
Contributions
Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome! If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
