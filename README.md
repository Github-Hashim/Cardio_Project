Heart Disease Prediction Project
Welcome to my Heart Disease Prediction project repository!

Overview
In this project, I've developed machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient attributes. Using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, I've implemented data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes to create accurate predictions.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
src/: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
preprocessing.py: Code for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
model_training.py: Code for training machine learning models.
evaluation.py: Code for evaluating model performance.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
LICENSE: Specifies the license for this project.
Getting Started
